 <b>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</b><br>
  This is a new open source repository is dedicated to the development and exploration of machine learning models, with a primary focus on dataset preprocessing and datacleaning. Our goal is to build, analyze, and improve various machine learning classifiers while highlighting the importance of high-quality data preprocessing in achieving accurate and robust results.

## How to Start and Rules 
1. Enter into the specific folder as per your preferred classifier (if classifier is preferred then focus on data preprocessing steps by taking complex and raw datasets and play with it)
2. Or if you would like to use multiple classifiers on a single dataset go into the multiclassifier models
3. Create a folder with the name of your project (training title) in that folder
4. Make a markdown file and specify the details of your ML model you are building (**Detailed Documentation of process is required**)
5. Now load the dataset folder you are going to use for training, validation and testing if the datset is too big or if not possible to push include the link or source of the dataset in the top of markdown file you created before(kaggle, drive, etc...)
6. Finally, start your training by making a JupyterNotebook in that folder, Explain the process happening in each cell (**must include data visualization during the preprocessing steps**)

## Contributing
Contributions are always welcome!

1. **Fork the repository.**
2. **Clone the Repository**

   Once you have forked the repository, clone it to your local development environment using the following command:

   ```sh
   https://github.com/<your_github_username>/AM_ACM-AI_ML_Models.git
   ```

   Replace **your-username** with your GitHub username.

3. **Create a Branch**

   Move into the project's directory and create a new branch for your contributions:

   ```sh
   cd AM_ACM-AI_ML_Models
   git checkout -b my-feature-branch
   ```

   Replace **my-feature-branch** with a descriptive branch name related to your changes.

4. **Make Your Changes**

   Now it's time to work on your contributions!

5. **Check the changed files**

   ```sh
   git status
   ```

6. **Commit Your Changes**

   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "<EXPLAIN-YOUR_CHANGES>"
   ```

7. **Push to Your Forked Repository**

   ```sh
   git push origin my-feature-branch
   ```

   Replace **my-feature-branch** with the name of your branch.

8. **Create a Pull Request**

   Go to your forked repository on GitHub, and you should see a "Compare & pull request" button. Click on it to create a pull request (PR) from your branch to the main repository.
