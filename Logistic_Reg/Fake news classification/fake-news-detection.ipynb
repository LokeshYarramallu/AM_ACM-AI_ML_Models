It involves the classification of news articles or text documents into two categories: \"genuine\" or \"true\" news and \"fake\" or \"misleading\" news. The most common logistic regression model models a binary outcome, which can take two values such as true/false, yes/no, and so on. Logistic Regression can be a useful algorithm for this task, especially when combined with NLP techniques. Here's an explanation of how you can use Logistic Regression and NLP for fake news detection:"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Importing Nltk library"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-10-20T15:23:50.928400Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-10-20T15:23:50.927912Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-10-20T15:23:50.935096Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-10-20T15:23:50.933263Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-10-20T15:23:50.928364Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["import nltk"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["NLTK is a suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing (NLP) for English written in the Python programming language.
